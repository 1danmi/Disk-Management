# Disk-Managment

In order to compile the main project, you first need to build the project "FMS5776_2075_3798",
and then build the project "FMS_DLL". Then you can build  FMS_Adapter and FMS_GUI.

The reason for that is that the first two project are written in native code, and the second projects in C#.
